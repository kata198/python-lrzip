1.1.0 - Jun 25 2017
* Better handling of resources in error condition
* Fix leaked fd
* Detect if shmfile is present ( https://github.com/kata198/shmfile ) and if
so, use shm files as oppose to "tmpfile" for input to liblrzip, so we are just working memory ->
memory, no disk required (at all on POSIX, where memstream's are also
supported)
